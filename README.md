Exprimental web browser for Kodi (XBMC)
----------------------------
This addon is an expriment with creating a web browser for Kodi as python addon. It is currently just for my own
learning and amusement and as such is unsupported. It renders pages by dynamically creating a skin file and also
requires installation of monospace font (due to limitations in Kodi skin rendering).
It can be hideously slow and currently only works well with some web pages.
It is also probably an example of how not to implement a web browser :)

It is only available on my [repository](http://ruuks-repo.googlecode.com/files/ruuk.addon.repository-1.0.0.zip).
